Between 1\nand 2 inches of rain has fallen across this area, on top of\n1-2 inches of rainfall which fell earlier this evening.\nWhile heavy rainfall is departing the area, excessive runoff\nwill continue over the next 1-2 hours, causing rapid rises on\nsmall streams and nuisance to Minor flooding of adjacent low-\nlying areas.\n\nWhile streams have receded from earlier heavy rainfall,\nincluding Little Sugar Creek, Briar Creek, Steele Creek and\nMcAlpine Creek, these streams and associated drainages are\nstarting to rise again and a few areas may exceed bankfull\nlevels, flooding adjacent greenways and other low-lying\nareas.  Isolated roadway flooding is imminent.\n\nAreas in northeastern York County, near Tega Cay and Fort\nMill, including near Springfield Parkway, SC 160, US 21, and\nOld Nation Rd, are also prone to flooding from this heavy\nrainfall.  Please exercise caution on area roadways and avoid\nlow-lying areas adjacent to area streams for the next few\nhours.\n\nFortunately, rainfall is ending across the Advisory area.  No\nadditional heavy rainfall is expected and conditions will\ngradually improve over the next few hours.\n\n- Some locations that may experience flooding include...\nRock Hill, Uptown Charlotte, Central Charlotte, South\nCharlotte, Southwest Charlotte, East Charlotte, Northeast\nCharlotte, Matthews, Mint Hill, Weddington, Fort Mill,\nPineville, Tega Cay, Lesslie, Marvin, The Arboretum,\nSouthpark Mall, Freedom Park, Carowinds and The Plaza.\n\n- Http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood",

Minor flooding is\nongoing or expected to begin shortly in the Advisory area.\nBetween 1 and 2 inches of rain have fallen in less than an\nhour, especially in a very localized area around Uptown\nCharlotte.  This is causing rapid rises on small drainages\nand streams in Charlotte, including Little Sugar Creek,\nespecially near Medical Center Dr.  Flooding of the Little\nSugar Creek greenway is ongoing and will persist over the\nnext 60-90 minutes.  Heavy rainfall is ending from west to\neast across Charlotte, with another 0.50-1 inch possible\ntowards Mint Hill.  Thereafter, additional heavy rainfall is\nnot expected over the next 1-2 hours.  However, additional\nheavy rainfall is possible later tonight and new areas of\nflooding may develop.\n\n- Some locations that may experience flooding include...\nUptown Charlotte, Central Charlotte, South Charlotte, East\nCharlotte, Northeast Charlotte, Southwest Charlotte,\nNorthwest Charlotte, West Concord, Matthews, Mint Hill,\nPineville, Harrisburg, The Plaza, Freedom Park, Hidden\nValley, Southpark Mall, Reedy Creek Park, The Arboretum, and\nUniversity City.",
